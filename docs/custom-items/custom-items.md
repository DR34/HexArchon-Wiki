## Crafting Stations

### Blacksmith and Sorcerer

The Blacksmith can craft and upgrade materials, weapons, repair stones/artifacts, and armor. The Blacksmith can be located at spawn or at `/warp crafting`.

The Sorcerer can craft potions, staffs, wands, catalysts, tomes, runes, and item essence. The Sorcerer can be located next to the Blacksmith at spawn.

### Upgrading Items

Items can be upgraded up to 5 levels at the Blacksmith using item essence and a portion of the item's crafting materials. Different item types also have different stat scaling per level. More information on item essence can be read below.

### Item Essence

Item essence can be crafted at the Sorcerer using Essence Powder which can be obtained by killing any normal or custom hostile mobs. Item essence can be used for upgrading items or repairing items. 

### Repairing Custom Items

Items can be repaired using Repair Stones and Artifacts based on their rarity. Repair Stones only repair a certain amount of durability, while Repair Artifacts can fully repair an item. Repair items can be crafted in the Blacksmith.

### Runes

Runes can be used to add stats to custom items depending on its rune type. They can be crafted in the Sorcerer.
