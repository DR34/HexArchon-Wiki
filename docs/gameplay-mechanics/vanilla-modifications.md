# Vanilla Modifications

The list of small modifications to vanilla Minecraft.

#### Keep Inventory

#### Items
* Milk Buckets will clear the bad omen effect.
* Totem of Undying will activate even if you do not have it equipped on hand.
* Elytras take 3x higher durability loss.
* Diamond Items require more Netherite Ingots to upgrade. The amount depends on their crafting recipe.
* Redstone components are not craftable, and can only be obtained from the shop.
* Tridents thrown from the offhand will return to the offhand.
* Tridents with Loyalty cannot be thrown through portals to avoid losing them.
* Tridents with Loyalty will still return to the player after getting thrown into the void.
**Note: You will need to get close to where the trident was thrown for this to work (< 32 Blocks)**
