# Boss Fights

![Bosses](./img/bosses.png)

Bosses are challenges you can take in `/boss`. Bosses get progressively harder, with each having their unique abilities and skills. The rewards include money, points, and XP. Up to 4 players can join a single boss arena, in which the amount of rewards will be dependent on the first/repeat completion divided by the amount of players.
