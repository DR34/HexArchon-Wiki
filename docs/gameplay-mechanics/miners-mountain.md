# Miner's Mountain
The Miner's Mountain is a mineshaft containing various ores such as Toughstone, Limestone, Blue, Red, and Purple Jewels, which are valuable crafting materials. You can level up your Relic Discovery Level and unlock many perks in the Relic Discovery Tree.

## Pickaxes
To start mining in the Miner's Mountain, you first need to craft a Toughstone Pickaxe. You can obtain Toughstone outside of the Miner's Mountain by mining ores and killing Stone Golems in the overworld. You can craft the Toughstone Pickaxe and other special pickaxes in the Archaic Reserves menu or the Blacksmith.

## Ore Index 
The Ore Index displays all ores in the Miner's Mountain and pickaxes that can break them. The Relic Mining Time (in red) is shown as well as the Relic Mining Speed for each pickaxe (in green).
