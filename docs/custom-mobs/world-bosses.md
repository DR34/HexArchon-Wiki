# World Bosses
About World Bosses and how to summon them.

World Bosses are bosses that can be fought in any of the survival worlds but require a specific method of summoning. World Bosses often require more players to defeat, as they have a lot of health and are much more difficult than typical custom mobs.

## Warden Anomaly

**Location:** Overworld (Warden's Well)<br />
**Drops:** Warden's Tribute.

### Summoning Steps

Craft the Warden's Call to Archon from the Sorcerer. Navigate to the coordinates [X: 0, Y: 0] in the main world (the world `/rtp` takes you), enter the underground city, and locate the Warden's Well. Hold the Warden's Call to Archon and right-click next to the Warden's Well to summon the Warden Anomaly.

### Summoning Steps

![Voidkeeper Summon](./img/voidkeeperspawn.png)

Upon killing Lesser Shadows (Floating Chainmail Armor), there is a very small chance of summoning a Corrupted Anchor which will deal damage within a radius. After destroying the Corrupted Anchor, a ritual will spawn containing 4 Netherite Seals. Destroy all 4 seals to summon the Voidkeeper.

Alternatively, you can also craft a Corrupted Anchor from the `/blacksmith` - albeit, at a very expensive price.
