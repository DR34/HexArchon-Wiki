# Bedrock Crossplay
You can join the server on Bedrock Edition using the IP `play.hexarchon.net` with Port `19132`. **Beware that Bedrock crossplay support is an extremely experimental feature of the server.** You will encounter many game breaking issues, and this feature may even be removed as this is just an experiment. The server is not even advertised as Bedrock crossplay supported.

## Bedrock Edition Issues
Due to the sheer complexity of HexArchon and crossplay in general, **full Bedrock support is impossible and will never be implemented**. Java and Bedrock Editions of Minecraft are completely different games in the code; everything is structured differently internally, and they don't even run on the same programming language. To translate the game code between versions of the game and apply it on a server far cry from vanilla Minecraft one to one... is impossible. Below is the list of issues you will experience playing on Bedrock Edition.<br />
* All custom textures don't show. This includes every item textures, armor textures, GUI textures, symbol textures, mana bar... etc.
* Certain particles don't show. This may introduce difficulties with mobs.
* Certain sounds are broken.
* Auctions cannot be opened.
* Repeatable quests category cannot be opened.
* Hardcore quests category cannot be opened.
* Abilities cannot be used.
* Mobs are invisible in certain uncommon cases. Their nametag will still show though.
* You may not receive items from certain events.
* Certain item functions may not work.
