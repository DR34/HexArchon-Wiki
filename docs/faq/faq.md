# FAQ
Frequently asked Questions and the answers.

### Is Keep Inventory on?
Keep Inventory is on throughout the entire server. However, you will lose 10% of your balance on death in the Overworld, Nether, The End, and the Skylands. You don't lose any in boss arenas, or dungeons.

### How do I obtain X item? What is X item used for?
Use the `/lookup` command to view how to obtain an item, and look up all recipes an item is used in.
Alternatively, for an in-depth detail on how to obtain an item, visit the [Items List](../custom-items/items-list.md) section of the wiki.

### What is Item Essence used for?
Visit the [Item Essence](../custom-items/custom-items.md/#item-essence) section of the wiki.

### How do you pick up spawners?

Yes, claims will protect your region all the way from bedrock to world height limit.

### What is the vanilla difficulty of the server?

### How do I submit a Suggestion or a Bug Report?
See the [Suggestions and Bugs](.//suggestions-and-bugs.md) page. **THE CHAT IS NOT THE CORRECT PLACE FOR THEM!**

### Why is my water or lava not flowing?
Claims may be interfering with the flow of your water or lava. By default, liquids cannot move across claim borders. To fix this, you can enlarge your claim, or allow liquid to flow across your borders in the `/claims` menu.

### Why is my sheep not regrowing wool?
You may have to enable the "Mob Griefing" global permission in your claim. To do this, stand in your claim and type `/claimsettings`. Click "Global Claim Settings", and navigate to "Advanced Configuration" (bottom right corner). Click the "Misc" option (crafting table), and under the Mob Griefing option, select Enable.

### Is Infernal Touch and Fortune compatible?
Yes, Infernal Touch will smelt all items multiplied from Fortune.

### Why do treasure maps not work?
Treasure maps are disabled as they cause severe lag spikes. Treasure maps load infinite chunks until it finds a structure - basically, imagine flying at light speed until it finds a treasure or the server crashes.

### How do I use fancy colors in commands such as /nick, /rename, etc?
Use these [color codes](https://i.redd.it/yldfhnb4xp411.png), or if you want to use gradients and hex colors, [use this website!](https://www.simplymc.art/Gradients)

### Why do my ability slot numbers keep changing?
The ability slot numbers that appear when you go into ability casting mode depends on your current active slot on your hotbar.

For example: In the `/abilities` menu, let's say you have Fire Storm bind to slot 1, Furtive Strike bind to slot 2, and Minor Healings bind to slot 3.

- If you have the first slot selected on your hotbar and go into ability casting mode, you will now have Fire Storm bind to [2], Furtive Strike bind to [3], and Minor Healings bind to [4].

- If you have the second slot selected on your hotbar, you will now have Fire Storm bind to [1], Furtive Strike bind to [3], and Minor Healings bind to [4].

- If you have the eighth slot selected on your hotbar, you will now have Fire Storm bind to [1], Furtive Strike bind to [2], and Minor Healings bind to [3].

This is due to a Minecraft limitation unfortunately - there is no way for the server to be notified of a key press event if you select a slot that is already selected.

### Why do my arrows keep bouncing off enemies?
If this is happening, you are either shooting arrows too quickly, or you are too far away from the mob.

Minecraft will bounce off arrows if an entity is hit during its invulnerability period. Therefore, if you are shooting arrows too quickly (especially with a bow that has Succession Custom Enchant applied on it), you will see this behavior often. We cannot do anything about this.

Arrows will also bounce off if you are too far away from the mob (past the mob's activation range).

### What is the World Size?
**Overworld** - 24,000 x 24,000 <br />
**Nether** - 8,000 x 8,000 <br />
**End** - 8,000 x 8,000 <br />
**Resource** - 24,000 x 24,000 <br />

### Is Chat Reporting (1.19.1) enabled?
Chat reporting is disabled due to compatibility and security issues.

### Are cracked accounts supported?
Cracked accounts are not supported and will never be supported, as it is physically impossible to do so following the enormous amounts of internal complications and security vulnerabilities it brings. Some examples are:
- No secure account authentication
- Having to support offline UUIDs
- No account lookups
- Minimal server software/plugin support
- Endless vulnerabilities regarding accounts
- Risks of botting to the server and backend services

There are moral complications as well. Supporting cracked accounts are *highly* frowned upon in the Minecraft server community - and we are not an exception.

### Will there be a Nether/End reset?
There will be a Nether/End reset once in a few months.

### Will there be a server reset?
There will never be a server reset, unless the majority of the community wants it.
