# Dungeons

Dungeons are objective-based timed raids that contain mobs, loot chests, and bosses. They can be joined in the `/dungeons` menu and allow up to 4 players to join co-op. Upon defeating the final boss of a dungeon, you can claim 1 of 3 reward chests which contain Runes, Custom Enchantments, Essence Powder, Materials, and Custom Items.
