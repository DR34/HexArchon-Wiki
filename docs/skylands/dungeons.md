# Dungeons

Dungeons are objective-based timed raids that contain mobs, loot chests, and bosses. Upon defeating the final boss of a dungeon, you can claim 1 of 3 reward chests which contain Runes, Custom Enchantments, Essence Powder, Materials, and Custom Items.

## Joining a Dungeon

Dungeons can be joined in the `/dungeons` menu. You can choose to either play solo, or create a party and invite up to 4 players to play co-op.
