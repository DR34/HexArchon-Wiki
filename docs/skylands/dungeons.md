# Dungeons

Dungeons are objective-based raids that contain main & side objectives, mobs, loot chests, and bosses. Upon defeating the final boss of a dungeon, you can claim 1 of 3 reward chests which contain Runes, Custom Enchantments, Essence Powder, Materials, and Custom Items.

## Starting a Dungeon

To start a dungeon, open the dungeon menu using `/dungeons`. Select a dungeon to join. Click "Start Dungeon" to start the dungeon solo, or co-op with up to 4 players _(must have a party setup before starting)._
