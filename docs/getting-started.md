# Getting Started
All about getting started on HexArchon.

## Welcome

Welcome! On HexArchon, players can explore the wilderness, interact with other players, fight unique custom mobs, challenge various dungeons, and gear up on custom items and equipments to survive in a unique environment.

## First Steps

The first step would be to use the `/rtp` command to teleport to a random place in the wilderness. This can be a great tool for starters or for those who want to explore!

## Claiming Land

Claiming Land is an important aspect of the server as it protects your builds from others.

To claim land, first type the command `/claim`. Then, right-click two corners (blocks) of your intended claim. A confirmation menu will pop up, in which you can confirm your claim creation.

### Giving other players access to your claim
#### Shortcut
To share access of your claim to other players, use the `/trust PlayerNameHere` command. From there, you can grant permissions to build, open chests, interact with mobs, and more! <br />

#### Detailed
![Claim Player Grant Build Permission](./img/getting-started/claims-grant-build-permission.gif)

Select the player you wish to add, and under the build permission, click Enable. If you want, you can also grant them the permission to open chests, interact with mobs, blocks, and more!

Warps can be used to quickly teleport to a public location of interest. To open the warps menu, use the command `/warp`.

## Teleporting

The teleport command can be used to teleport to other players with ease. To send a teleport request to a player, you can use the command `/tpa <playername>.` In addition, `/tpahere <playername>` can be used to request a player to teleport to you. The specified player can choose to either accept or deny the request using `/tpyes` or `/tpno`.

:::info
The player who is teleporting must stand still for 3 seconds for the teleport to take place.

## Homes

Want to save place you want, such as your house? Do a /sethome! You can then use /home to teleport back to that place.
You can also create up to 5 homes, by using `/sethome <homename>`, and using `/home <homename>`. <br />
To remove homes, use the `/delhome <homename>` command. <br />

## Death

Did you die? No worries, you can use `/back` to go back to where you died!

:::warning
You will lose 10% of your balance on death! This does not apply in Boss Arenas or Dungeons.
