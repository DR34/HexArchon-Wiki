Welcome! On HexArchon, players can explore the wilderness, interact with other players, fight unique custom mobs, challenge various dungeons, and gear up on custom items and equipments to survive in a unique environment.

## First Steps

The first step would be to use the `/rtp` command to teleport to a random place in the wilderness. This can be a great tool for starters or for those who want to explore.

## Claiming Land

Claiming Land is an important aspect of the server as it protects your builds from others.

To claim land, first type the command `/claim`. Then, right-click two corners (blocks) of your intended claim. A confirmation menu will pop up, in which you can confirm your claim creation.

### Giving other players access to your claim
You can give access of your claim to other players, such as a friend. To do this, type the command `/claims`. Note the added `s`!
